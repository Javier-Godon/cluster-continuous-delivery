# Cluster Continuous Delivery

This repository is designed to facilitate the deployment of projects on Kubernetes using modern tools like Crossplane, KCL, and ArgoCD. It is organized into four main directories, each serving a specific purpose:

---

## ðŸ“‚ [.github](https://github.com/Javier-Godon/cluster-continuous-delivery/tree/main/.github)

This folder contains workflows for **GitHub Actions**, divided into two main groups:

1. **Image Tag Update Workflows**  
   These workflows automatically update the container image tag in the Kubernetes manifests whenever changes to the project code are merged into the `main` branch.

2. **Kubernetes Manifest Update Workflow**  
   The [generate-manifests-from-kcl.yaml](https://github.com/Javier-Godon/cluster-continuous-delivery/blob/main/.github/workflows/generate-manifests-from-kcl.yaml) workflow updates Kubernetes manifests when deployment configuration files are modified manually.

---

## ðŸ“‚ [apps](https://github.com/Javier-Godon/cluster-continuous-delivery/tree/main/apps)

This folder contains the **KCL configurations** required to generate Kubernetes manifests for deployment. 

- The repository uses the [Konfig](https://www.kcl-lang.io/docs/user_docs/guides/working-with-konfig/overview) library from KCL, enabling the generation of all necessary manifests with minimal configuration.  
- Each project has its own subfolder:
  - A `base` folder containing shared project configurations.
  - Environment-specific folders (e.g., `dev`, `prod`) with configurations unique to that environment.

### âœ¨ Key Features:
- **Dynamic ConfigMaps**: Using string interpolation, variables, and schemas in KCL, you can easily define and manage Kubernetes ConfigMaps.

---

## ðŸ“‚ [infrastructure-crossplane](https://github.com/Javier-Godon/cluster-continuous-delivery/tree/main/infrastructure-crossplane)

This folder contains the necessary **Crossplane manifests** and **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)** for each provider to deploy the required infrastructure for each project. 

- The `managed_resources` folder organizes the manifests by tool, making it easy to locate and manage resources.

---

## ðŸ“‚ [argocd](https://github.com/Javier-Godon/cluster-continuous-delivery/tree/main/argocd)

This folder includes the **ArgoCD manifests** required to implement GitOps, ensuring that the Kubernetes resources defined in the repository are deployed and synchronized effectively.

---

## ðŸš€ Key Technologies
- **KCL**: Simplifies the configuration of Kubernetes manifests and dynamic resource management.
- **Crossplane**: Manages the infrastructure needed for each project directly within Kubernetes.
- **ArgoCD**: Implements GitOps to automate and synchronize deployments.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates CI/CD workflows and manifest generation.
